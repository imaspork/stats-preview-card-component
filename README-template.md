## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

-   View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size

## My process

I originally was going to do a mobile first approach, but I decided to focus on desktop first because 1440px X 900px was an odd resolution to start with (1440 width given by instructions). I first built a skeleton struction with flex box. Next I focused on the the structural design (left and right portions properly being responsive). Next I focused on font sizing, colors, and padding. Finally I added small tweaks via media queries and certain units to ensure the final card component is responsive.

### Built with

-   Semantic HTML5 markup
-   CSS custom properties
-   Flexbox

### What I learned

I learned about methods to add an opacity to an image and or hue tint it. I found the option of using an ::after psuedo class, and the option to use a linear gradient with an RGB opacity. I went with the linear gradient with RGB opacity route because it was simpler and less likely to cause issues. Everything else in this project was knowledge I already knew. It was just a matter of actually putting it together!
